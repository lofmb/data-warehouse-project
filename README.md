# SQL DataWarehouse Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **complete data warehouse implementation** built with **SQL Server**.  
It demonstrates the use of **ETL processes, data modelling, and analytics** using CSV files as source data.  

The repository is designed as a **self-learning project for beginners in data engineering** while providing a solid foundation for building end-to-end data warehouse solutions.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
> The detailed repository structure will be established as the project evolves.  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- **Data Modeling:** Star-schema or snowflake schema implementation for data warehousing.  
- **ETL Processes:** Scripts for extraction from CSV sources, transformation (cleaning & formatting), and loading into SQL Server.  
- **Data Analytics:** Sample queries and reports for exploring warehouse data (to be expanded).  
- **Documentation:** Diagrams and notes describing the design and process.  

---

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. **Data Source:** Import CSV files containing raw data.  
2. **ETL Layer:** Transform and clean raw data via scripts.  
3. **Data Warehouse:** Load structured data into SQL Server tables.  
4. **Analysis:** Run SQL queries for reporting and insights.
